I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Don't, don't accept defeat
Cruise in the fast lane
Take, take or donate
Dark skies and heavy rain
Bright lights and cocaine
